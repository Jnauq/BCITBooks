<div class="about-us">
    <h2 class="about-h2">Who We Are</h2>
    <p class="about-desc">We are a team of five, term 1 students enrolled in BCIT's
    Computer Systems Technology program.  We were inspired by Metro Vancouver to help make a
    difference in the battle to reduce food waste in our community by educating, raising awareness
    and creating a behavioural change.

    <h2 class="about-h2">Mission</h2>
    
    <div class="about-desc">
        <p class="about-mission"><i>"To inspire communities to be more conscious about food waste
        by connecting them through food sharing"</i></p>
        <p>We want to seek sustainable solutions
        for the food waste problem and connect communities together.  We aim to expand
        the sharing economy by offering people a platform to share their excess food and ingredients
        with others in their community.  By doing so, less food will end up in landfills and and more
        food will end up in our bellies.</p>
